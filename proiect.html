            Introduction
        </h1>

        	<p>
        		AICO is an application designed to offer solutions for airsoft players looking to enhance their experience and link up easier with people to play with. The application has 3 main components: 
        		<ul>
				  <li>Organizing and finding games through the mobile application</li>
				  <li>Enhancing the experience on the field with AR technology</li>
				  <li>Referee interface for spectating the game to ensure a fair match</li>
				</ul>

				The interaction with the application is analyzed on 4 personas: The gamer, the athlete, the referee and the concerned parent.
        	</p>

        <h1>
            Interaction types
        </h1>

	        <p>
	        	Interaction types define the way the user sends and receives information to and from the application.
	        	The designed application includes a variety of interaction types and offers a fair chance to people who couldn't enjoy airsoft before due to certain disabilities.

	        	<ul>
	        		<li>
	        			Traditional: The referee is using a web interface to see real time footage from the field.
	        		</li>
	        		<li>
	        			Touchscreen: The players are using the touchscreen interface of the mobile application in order to organize and find games.
	        		</li>
	        		<li>
	        			Hand gestures: Players can use gestures to communicate different types of predefined callouts. The gestures are detected by the smartwatch and can be used for example for pings visible on the augmented field.
	        		</li>
	        		<li>
	        			AR: The AR glasses provide the player a wide range of additional information such as the position of their teammates, objectives, spotted enemies, pings, gun ammo, zone restrictions and much more.
	        		</li>
	        		<li>
	        			Voice: The players can communicate with eachother using the microphone in their smartwatch.
	        		</li>
	        	</ul>

	        	There are several helping features for people with disabilities. Deaf people can better visualize their surroundings and also receive help in the form of augmented visual markers that indicate where certain sounds are coming from. Mute people can communicate using the gesture system.

	        </p>

        <h1>
            Design Patterns
        </h1>

        <p>
        	Design patterns provide standardized solutions to frequently encountered problems. The most significant design patterns present in our application would be:


        	<ul>
        		<li>
        			Alternate rows: Improves readability of a table by sligthly changing the color tone of adjacent rows.

    				Examples:

    				<figure>
    					<img src="design patterns/alternate_rows.jpg">
    					<figcaption>
    						Player scoreboard
    					</figcaption>
    				</figure>

    				<figure>
    				    <img src="design patterns/expand_collapse_1.jpg">
    				    <figcaption>
    						Filters for finding matches
    					</figcaption>
    				</figure>

        		</li>

        		<li>
        			Alternate views: Useful for allowing the same data to be viewed differently by users with different preferences.

        			Examples:

    				<figure>
    				    <img src="design patterns/alternate_views.jpg">
    				    <figcaption>
    						Different cameras layout options
    					</figcaption>
    				</figure>

        		</li>

        		<li>
        			
        			Date picker: Provies an intuitive way for the user to input a date without any confusion related to the format of the date.

        			Example:

    				<figure>
    				    <img src="design patterns/date_picker.jpg">
    				    <figcaption>
    						Calendar
    					</figcaption>
    				</figure>


        		</li>

        		<li>
        			Time picker: Similar to date picker but for choosing an hour.

        			Example:

					<figure>
    				    <img src="design patterns/time_picker.jpg">
    				    <figcaption>
    						Clock
    					</figcaption>
    				</figure>
        		</li>

        		<li>
        			Expand/Collapse: It is recomended when certain information is not required to be visible at all times but should be easily reachable.


        			Example:

					<figure>
				    <img src="design patterns/expand_collapse3.png">
				    <figcaption>
						Players panel and filters panel
					</figcaption>

    				</figure>

    				<figure>
				    <img src="design patterns/expand_collapse2.png">
				    <figcaption>
						Expands the game browse filters
					</figcaption>

    				</figure>
        		</li>

        		<li>
	        		Secure input: This pattern ensures that sensitive information is not visible unless the user decides to reveal it.

					Example:

					<figure>
				    <img src="design patterns/hide.jpg">
				    <figcaption>
						Hidden card info
					</figcaption>

    				</figure>

    				<figure>
				    <img src="design patterns/hide2.jpg">
				    <figcaption>
						Hidden password
					</figcaption>

    				</figure>


        		</li>

        		<li>
        			Infinite scrolling: Continously provides a stream of content to the user (as long as there is enough content)

        			Example:

        			<figure>
				    <img src="design patterns/infinite scrolling.jpg">
				    <figcaption>
						Available matches
					</figcaption>

    				</figure>

        		</li>

        		<li>
        			Notifications: Provides a synthesis of the important events at the moment they occur as well as getting feedback from the interactions.

        			Example:

        			<figure>
				    <img src="design patterns/notifications.jpg">
				    <figcaption>
						Notifications
					</figcaption>

    				</figure>

        		</li>

        	</ul>

Other players join his game and meet with Denis at the decided location where they have a fun airsoft experience. They use the provided equipment including a smartwatch, a bluetooth connected weapon and some AR glasses. At the end of the game they can check their scores and stats during the match.

He picks a game and on the selected date welcomes the players on the field. After making sure that everyone is present and understood the explained rules he monitors the players using the cameras integrated in the glasses to make sure everyone is playing fairly.
